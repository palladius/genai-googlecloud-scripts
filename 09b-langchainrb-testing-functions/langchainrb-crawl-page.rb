# content_tmp = "Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins t
# hat are not fused to the head. Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii) and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays a
# nd kin). Some sources extend the term \"shark\" as an informal category including extinct members of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a shark-like
# morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the Devonian Period (419‚Äì359 million years)
# , though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician (458‚Äì444 million years ago). The oldest confirmed modern sharks (se
# lachimorphs) are known from the Early Jurassic, about 200 million years ago, though records of true sharks may extend back as far as the Permian.
# Sharks range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species that is only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to the wha
# le shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres (40 ft) in length. They are found in all seas and are co
# mmon to depths up to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater, although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark
#  and the river shark, which can be found in both seawater and freshwater. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage
#  and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.
# Several species are apex predators, which are organisms that are at the top of their food chain. Select examples include the tiger shark, blue shark, gre
# at white shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and hammerhead shark.
# Sharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup. Many shark populations are threatened by human activities. Since 1970, shark populations ha
# ve been reduced by 71%, mostly from overfishing."
