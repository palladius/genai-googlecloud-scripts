## Prompt 1

Make me a captivating endless runner game. Key instructions on the screen. p5js scene, no HTML. I like pixelated red dragons and dungeon-like backgrounds.

## Prompt 2

Oh wow this is amazing! Now please change the code in two ways:

When you start you can choose among 4 named characters: a red dragon ("Ale"), a giraffe ("Seby"), a puffin ("Papino") or a waffle ("waffle"). Less pixelated than it is now please.

with SPACE you have single/double jump - as it is

with letter "f/F" you spit fire on obstacles and destroy them with a mini explosion effect. This gives you five points

always visualize score on top right.
