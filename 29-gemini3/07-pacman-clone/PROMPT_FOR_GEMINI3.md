## Prompt 1
Please create a p5js clone of Pacman game. It should be playable both with a computer and with a phone, hence with keyboard and with tapping the phone.

## Prompt 2
no sbrodola.sh. Just a SINGLE script.js to paste in p5.js editor.

## Prompt 3
wow, fantastic, thanks! The app works, however there are a couple of bugs:

1. the cage with 4 monsters is closed, there's no hole for them to get out.

2. I can't move in all places, by trying around there seems to be an off-by-one offset since i can go everywhere except the squares closest to a wall

3. Also the lateral "teleport" places are not in the grid: while I see the code to support the teleport, there's no lateral wall. So basically we need to edit the blue board for this too.

## Prompt 4
Wow, it works GREAT! one last thing. the teleport. Now there's a hole in the grid but then i get stuck in that square, it doesnt actually teleport on the other side. Try to fix that code please

## Prompt 5
the teleport works, great! One thing I've always desired is to also have holes for teleport in VERTICAL. Can you also do holes in North and Sourth wall and have same teleport functionality in vertical sense? So i can fool thos ghosts better :)

## Prompt 6
so on the computer the game is PERFECT. on mobile, its unplayable:

1. The rendering of the page is a small square on top left, leaving most of the screen white. I believe it should have 100% width and possibly be centered.

2. the controls are really bad. i struggle to go letf or right, it seems to go down but struggles to the right. probably this is cause by the fact that the square is so small.
