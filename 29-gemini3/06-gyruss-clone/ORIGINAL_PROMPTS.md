## Prompt 1
Please create a p5js clone of Gyruss game. It should be playable both with keyboard (cursor and SPACE to shoot) and with tapping the phone.
Our ship is white 'G', and all other ships should have one of the 4 Google colors (red blue green yellow).
Shooting at other ships makes a small explosion and increases the score.
1 ship in 5 is very fast, and it scores 3x to kill it.
