I want to demonostrate the power of Gemini 3.0 vs Gemini 2.5.
I have a symlink to a folder (`24-gemini25-games/`) which contains a number of games.

For each game I should have:
1. Code (I dont care about it)
2. Firebase config (I care little)
3. Pormpt which originated that game (the most important part).

In this fodler I'll host the code for the same games revisited by Gemini 3.0 model.

I've written article here: https://medium.com/@palladiusbonton/wip-code-3d-kid-games-with-gemini-2-5-d580d6b9802b with some prompts in the article.
