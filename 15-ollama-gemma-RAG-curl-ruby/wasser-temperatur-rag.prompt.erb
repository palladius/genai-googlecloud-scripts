Can you please tell me the Water Temperature of Seebad Enge and Seebad Utoquai from this doc?
I'll attach a document I just downloaded from the internet with current temperatures as of
<%= date_today %>.

=== Website curl ===

Here are the real temperatures:

<%= rag_from_website %>

=== Sample answer ===

Answer should be in JSON, something like:

{
     "Seebad Enge": ".." ,
     "Seebad Utoquai": ".."
}

=== Your answer ===

Your JSON answer (make sure to subsitute temperature with intefers you got from the Website Curl, also avoid the ```json``` part since its redundant):
