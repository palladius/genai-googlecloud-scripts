Energetic, stylized cartoon animation. Think a blend of the original Saint Seiya anime's dynamic posing and exaggerated expressions,
but with a modern, slightly more fluid and expressive look.  Bold outlines, vibrant colors, and lots of speed lines and energy effects.
Imagine something like "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem" meets "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World" in terms of visual flair,
but with the classic Saint Seiya armor design and poses.
