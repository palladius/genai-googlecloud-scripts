Full proposal content:

Proposal title: A News Crawler agent with Langchain, Ruby, Gemini APIs on Android

Abstract: How can we get an LLM to be updated to today‚Äôs news? Gen AI is great at answering questions.. from the past. After the LLM was trained, all you can do is RAG.

Imagine this: How about asking your android phone for latest news about X Y Z, having an agent crawling the web for latest news with Gemini for multimodal extraction, offering summarization by your favorite topic and also saving to local DB for further processing, like similarity search?

Other info: This is a 30m slides + demo-intensive showing 4 small demos

Language: en

Tags: AI/ML, Development, Database

Level: Advanced
