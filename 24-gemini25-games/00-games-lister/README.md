# Riccardo's Kid's Awesome Games! 🕹️

This project is a simple web page that lists a collection of games for kids. It's a personal project by Riccardo, a father of two, to provide a fun and safe gaming environment for his children.

## Games List

Here are some of the games available:

*   **Dungeon Runner:** An endless runner featuring family members. It's an horizontal infinite slider like Mario Bros. 😉
*   **Smurfs & Dragons (Math Shooter):** Math practice with a Smurf/Dragon theme! Now that's what I call Edutainment™! 🤓
*   **3D Googley Lego Tetris:** Tetris with Google-coloured Lego in 3D. A spectacular creation, apparently. ✨
*   **2D Legoey Tetris:** The 2D version, for those of us who find 3D *too* stimulating. Back to basics! 😎
*   **Multilingual Anagrams:** Anagram game in multiple languages! Kate *must* see this! 🗣️
*   **Paolo's Game (with Dutch/Lithuanian):** Riccardo's friend Paolo's cool game, now even more international! 🌍
*   **PacMan clone:** Riccardo version of pacman
*   **Dungemoji:** (amazing dungeon game, needs a keyboard) 🌍
*   **Connect 4:** (a classic 🟡🔴🔴🔴🔴🟡 for two players)
