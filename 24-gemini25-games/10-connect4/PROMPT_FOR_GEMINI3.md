Create a Connect "4 game" in p5.js. Game needs to be playable by 2 players on both web with keyboard (1-7) and mobile, so we need 7 buttons below the 7 directions. Also add a small BACK functionality because playing in 2 might be challenging and a player might press twice a button. Identify the winner. Base should be blue and balls should be red and yellow. Use a decent graphic rendering of the button going from top to bottom.

1. Make the animation 60% faster.
2. The game is very HARD to play in mobile. This is because the column 1 disappears and i cant see it. i can drop balls there but its invisible. Also my kid find it difficult to play this way as buttons are detached by the 7x6 keyboard. Make sure the buttons are attached to the 7 base (probably making it a 7x7 keyboard with the lower part having the 7b buttons), and that the whole keyboard is visible at all times.

Kudos if you're able to capture the touch on mobile - so say I press anything in column 5 -> that triggers that player ball in column 5. That would be the ideal behaviour if you can.

When the player wins, I'd like the page to change quite a bit. At the moment my kids dont even understand one won. Maybe recolor the white balls to gray, or blur down the chessboard, anything.
